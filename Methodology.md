# Pentest methodology (oriented bug bounty)
Hi ! My name is **Slash** and i'm studying security at a school training cybersecurity engineers, called **ENSIBS**. I've decided to make this document in order to help myself to make my pentest methodology strictier. Hopefully this guide will also help you during your pentests. In order to do so, I'll share with you the **vulnerabilities** I'm testing during my Bug Bounty sessions, **payloads**, **tools** and ressources I use.

Without going further, let's get started !

## Phase 0 : Find your target

## Phase 1 : Scan your target

## Phase 2 : Exploit your target

## Phase 3 : Make a good report
