# Pentest methodology (oriented bug bounty)
<p align="justify">
Hi ! My name is **Slash** and i'm studying security at a french school, training cybersecurity engineers, called **ENSIBS**. I've decided to make this document in order to help myself to make my pentest methodology strictier. Hopefully this guide will also help you during your pentests. In order to do so, I'll share with you the **vulnerabilities** I'm testing during my Bug Bounty sessions, **payloads**, **tools** and ressources I use.

This methodology will be web-oriented since websec is what is driving me.

Without going further, let's get started !

## Phase 0 : Find your target
</p>
*Note : If you're only pentesting, feel free to skip this phase. Nonetheless, you could still find some interesting discovery tools here.*

Alright, so the first step you need to do in order to start Bug Bounty is to find the target you'll spend some time on. If you're testing web applications, you have two options :
- Choose one of the full domain specified
- Usually on Bug Bounty, subdomains are in scope (\*.domain.com) so you need to find the subdomain you want to test.

We will cover the second options since the first one is pretty straight forward. Everyone has it own method so let me cover mine, perhaps it will give you some new ideas.

The tools I use personnaly are the following ones :
- Subfinder : This is an automated tool that will passively discovers subdomains. This one is easy to use and can be controlled through multiples parameters, that's why I've chosen it. Here's the way I'm using it :
```
TODO
```

- Amass : This is an OWASP project that perfoms DNS enumeration. This tool is complete and propose a gigantic amount of functions so it is perfect to use alongside subfinder. Here's the way I'm using it :
```
TODO
```

You can get these amazing tools here :

## Phase 1 : Scan your target

## Phase 2 : Exploit your target

## Phase 3 : Make a good report
